# Odin-Landing-Page
- First landing page project and second project in The Odin Project curriculum
- Putting content on the website and styling it with CSS was easy
- One thing I had a problem with was making a website responsive, and it's still not responsive - future TODO
- I streamed this project on YouTube you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3NIZmFufYA&t=13s)
